## Objective:

As a Business Analyst for EMD Solutions, a fictional vertical B2B SaaS startup, one of your tasks is to analyze historical sales data and provide insights to the leadership team regarding sales performance across the EMD Solutions product suite. EMD Solutions provides financial modeling, analytics, accounting and reporting tools to small businesses across the United States, who would otherwise have to buld, maintain and staff more-robust financial functions on their own.

Our Leadership team is looking to expand our current product offering, and in order to successfully launch, they are eager to answer the following business question: ***"Has the total addressable market (TAM) and advertising spend significantly influenced historical sales performance, and if so, what is the optimal allocation of our advertising budget to maximize sales?"***

## Data and Task Guidelines:

You have been provided a raw data file containing sales and advertising expense data. 

1. Summarize Historical Performance:
  * Plot the overall sales trend for the entire data period.
  * Calculate any seasonal patterns or trends (if applicable).
  * Provide insights into the general sales performance and trends over time.
  * You may assume the data is complete (i.e. the data does not contain duplicates, and that all test data has been removed).


2. Perform Segmentation Analysis:
  * Propose three segmentations of the customer revenue data that you think will be helpful for producing actionable business insights.
  * Analyze the characteristics and preferences of each segment.
  * Have segment characteristics and preferences changed over time?
    

3. Identify Relationship between the total addressable market (TAM) and marketing expenditures, and the average monthly revenue per product:
  * Clean the data:
    * We have previously analyzed the historical sales data and observed two items worth noting:
        * New accounts take about a year to season and fully utilize the modules they are subscribed to.
        * Even though we have clients that are in the Research industry, we have never historically marketed to Research firms the past (i.e. Customer_Type = Research).
        * Feel free to make additional data exclusions if you determine it is appropriate. Please describe the exclusions and your thought process.
  * Build a model!
     * Build a model to quantify the relationship between average monthly revenue and total addressable market (TAM).
     * Build a model to quantify the relationship between average monthly revenue and marketing expenditures.
     * Analysis:
         * Build a model that describes the relationship between sales and total addressable market (TAM). Interpret the results and discuss the implications for decision-making.
         * Build a model that describes the relationship between sales and marketing expenditures. Interpret the results and discuss the implications for decision-making.
         * Explore whether the impact of total addressable market (TAM) on sales varies among different customer segments.
         * Explore whether the impact of marketing spend on sales varies among different customer segments.
         * With the data provided, are there any alternative models to consider? If so, please build one and describe its merits. Interpret the results and discuss the implications for decision-making.  
     * For five new products the Leadership team would like to launch:
         * Please use the following assumptions:
            * All products must launch.
            * Each of the new products has a $2M, $4M, $6M, $8M, and $10M TAM, respectively.
            * The Marketing team has a budget of $250,000. You may recommend to use some, all, or none of the budget.
         * Use the most reliable model you have available (from the steps above). 
         * How would you allocate a $250,000.00 marketing budget? Describe your thought process.
         * How much average monthly revenue do you anticipate from each product based on your marketing budget allocation?
         

## Submission:

Please submit your analysis and findings in Google Sheets file containing the calculated results, charts, and notes/descriptions. Your report should include a concise executive summary (no more than 1 page), methodology, analysis, and actionable insights and recommendations.
