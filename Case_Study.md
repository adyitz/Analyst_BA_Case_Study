## Objective:

As a Business Analyst for EMD Solutions, a fictional vertical B2B SaaS startup, one of your tasks is to analyze historical sales data and provide insights to the leadership team regarding sales performance across the EMD Solutions product suite. 

The management team is looking to expand the product offering, and in order to successfully launch, they are eager to answer the following business question: ***"Has the total addressable market (TAM) and advertising spend significantly influenced historical sales performance, and if so, what is the optimal allocation of our advertising budget to maximize sales?"***

## Data and Task Guidelines:

You have been provided a raw data file containing sales and advertising expense data. 

1. Summarize Historical Performance:
  * Plot the overall sales trend for the entire data period.
  * Calculate any seasonal patterns or trends (if applicable).
  * Provide insights into the general sales performance and trends over time.
  * You may assume the data is complete (i.e. the data does not contain duplicates, and that all test data has been removed).

2. Perform Segmentation Analysis:
  * Propose three segmentations of the customer revenue data that you think will be helpful for producing actionable business insights.
  * Analyze the characteristics and preferences of each segment.
  * Explore whether the impact of total addressable market (TAM) on sales varies among different customer segments.
  * Explore whether the impact of marketing spend on sales varies among different customer segments.

3. Identify Relationship between the total addressable market (TAM) and marketing expenditures, and the average monthly revenue per product:
  * Clean the data:
    * We have previously analyzed the historical sales data and observed two items worth noting:
        * New accounts take about a year to season and reach full utilization of the modules they are subscribed to.
        * Even though we have clients that are in the Research industry, we have never marketed to Research firms the past (i.e. Customer_Type = Research).
  * Build a model:
     * Build a model to quantify the relationship between sales and total addressable market (TAM).
     * Build a model to quantify the relationship between sales and marketing expenditures.
     * Questions:
         * Describe the relationship between sales and total addressable market (TAM). Interpret the results and discuss the implications for decision-making.
         * Describe the relationship between sales and marketing expenditures. Interpret the results and discuss the implications for decision-making.
         * With the data provided, are there any alternative models to consider? If so, please build one and describe its merits. Interpret the results and discuss the implications for decision-making.  
     * For the five new products the Leadership team would like to launch:
         * How would you allocate a $200,000.00 marketing budget?
         * For the strongest model you have, and based on your allocation, how much average monthly revenue do you anticipate from each product?


Submission:

Please submit your analysis and findings in Google Sheets file containing the calculated results and charts. Your report should include a concise executive summary (no more than 1 page), methodology, analysis, and actionable insights addressing the business question.
